# Discord Token Checker/Validator
*The smallest + fastest Discord token checker (Done in 11 lines of code, uses multiprocessing for speed!)*

## Usage
* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8+) if you haven't already
* Put your tokens in `tokens.txt`, each token should be on its own line.
* Run checker.py (either via `python3 checker.py` or `py checker.py`)
* Working/valid tokens will be put into `working.txt`
